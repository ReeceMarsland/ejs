If a beam is broken before the start of the timer, a false start shall be
indicated

No other condition shall cause a false start indication

For a system using two (or more) columns of beams:

  The beam column closest to the start/finish line shall be the line beam

  The beam column closest to the first hurdle shall be the passing beam

Once the timer has started, each time the line beam is broken ("safe"
or not), an updated elapsed time shall be shown

Each time the passing beam is broken or cleared, the line beam shall
be "safe" for 2 seconds

If the line beam is broken while not "safe" a pass fault shall be
indicated for at least 2 seconds

No other condition shall cause a pass fault indication
